1. Every Halo Game, Ranked From Worst To Best (According To Metacritic):
    Spartan Strike: Lack of multiplayer hurt its appeal, but it improved on its predecessor with tighter gameplay and more content. User score: 6.4.
   Spartan Assault: Different perspective, same look and sound, lacking in scale and storytelling. Fans disappointed with microtransactions. User score: 4.6.
2. Battlefield(dark protocol): Killswitch is our new limited time game mode. Your objective is to secure AI nodes, and to use the on-site Forge to create a swarm of synthetic soldiers: Geists, who'll fight alongside anyone that spawns them. Defend your objectives, survive the onslaught, and stop the AI's spread.
